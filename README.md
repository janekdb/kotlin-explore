Welcome to my Kotlin learning project!

This project contains a WIP implementation of John Conway's Game of Life.

Some programmers have a goto challenge they like to code as they learn a language.

For me it's Game of Life which I've coded up in C, C++, SuperCard, Scala, Julia, Java, JavaScript and now Kotlin.
